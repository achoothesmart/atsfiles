hi, this is Prasanna Ashok. I've heard about your walk-in for a Java Developer. I did Masters degree in Computer Applications in Saranathan College of Engineering with a percentage of 74. I have good technical cum communication skills. I am doing more projects & websites in various languages & platforms. 

Some Industrial Experience:
I have done a project for Premier Electronics, Bangalore which automates their particular work.
I have designed & launched a website for a Trichy based catering company (shreeadhithyacatering.in).

If you give me an opportunity in your organization, i will definitely give my best for the success of my company
Thank you
